Psych Engine on the PSX LOL

Jokes aside, this is a modified version of [PSXFunkin'](https://github.com/cuckydev/PSXFunkin), a port of Friday Night Funkin to the original Sony Playstation by CuckyDev, where it has been modified to resemble the Psych Engine (though it may take inspiration from other engines also).  
It is meant to have various additonal features, so it can be used as a framework for other ports, including but not limited to:

Simple dialogue system  
STR video file playback  
Basic debug options (step counter, move characters)  
Working misses and accuaracy system  
and some other stuff I can't think of lmao  

Fittingly, this engine was originally made for a port of Mind Games to the PSX, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/BiliousData/PSycheX)


## Compilation
If you are on Linux and already have the dependencies installed, you can just run the compile.sh script, so you don't have to type all of those commands. (make sure you have already put the license and psyq folder there though)  
No MSYS2 version yet.

Or, you can go the old way and just refer to [COMPILE.md](/COMPILE.md).

## Shoutouts
[Nintendo Bro,](https://github.com/Nintendo-Bro385) they are the one that started the Mind Games port in the first place.  
[IgorSou3000,](https://github.com/IgorSou3000) they helped with countless things, such as pointing out my stupid mistakes, and making the accuracy calculations work.  
MaxDev, he made the original lua script for the timer.  
[CuckyDev](https://github.com/cuckydev) he made PSXFunkin lmao  

## Disclaimer
This project is not endorsed by the original Friday Night Funkin' devs or the Psych Engine devs, or anybody else. This is just an unofficial fan project because I was bored.

If any of the devs of any original project, like PSXFunkin' or Psych Engine isn't okay with this, let me know and I will take this down.
